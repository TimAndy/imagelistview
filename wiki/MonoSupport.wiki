#summary Notes on Mono support

= Mono Support =

ImageListView was tested on Mono 2.6.1. The control is almost feature complete on Mono with two exceptions:

  * The Type column is not populated. This is a known issue and will be addressed in a future release.
  * Thumbnail generation with large images is slower than the Windows version, due to the fact that a [http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/21zw9ah6.aspx particular overload] of the Image.!FromStream method used by the control is not supported on Mono.
