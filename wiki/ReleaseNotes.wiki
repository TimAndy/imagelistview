  * Removed the confusing AllowItemDrag property from !ImageListView.
  * Moved the scroll timer in to the navigation manager.
  * Fixed a bug in !ImageListViewItemCollection.!RemoveAt method where the control's !OnSelectionChanged event was fired after the item was removed from the collection.
  * Default renderer now shades the background of !SortColumn in Details mode.

= 2.3 (15 December 2009) =

= 2.2 (13 December 2009) =

  * Cleaned up the utility class.
  * Moved default and error images to the neutral resource.
  * Fixed places where !ImageListViewRenderer.Refresh was called instead of Control.Refresh. This should increase rendering performance.

  * Added the new column types to !ImageListViewItemComparer.

= 1.4 (07 December 2009) =

  * Added the !BeginEdit and !EndEdit methods to !ImageListViewItem. They should be used while editing items to prevent collisions with cache threads.
  * Custom renderers now use the central thumbnail cache instead of their own worker threads.

= 1.3 (04 December 2009) =

  * Moved the !ThumbnailFromFile method to the static Utility class. It is used by all renderers.
  * Renderers now check the thumbnails for errors.
  * !ImageListViewItem.!GetSubItemText now returns an empty string for uninitialized item properties.
  * !ImageListViewCacheManager now checks the thumbnails for errors.
  * !StringFormats are now properly disposed.

= 1.2 (03 December 2009) =

 * Cached images are now properly disposed.

= 1.1 (30 November 2009) =
  * Fixed !ImageListView.!EnsureVisible to work with the Gallery mode.
  * !ImageListViewCacheManager now properly zeroes out the memory used when it clears the cache. 
  * The preview image is now loaded by a background thread in Gallery view mode. 
  * Threaded renderers now use a !BackgroundWorker.
  * Preview image in Gallery mode is now cached. 
  * Introduced Tuples, used mainly while talking to worker threads. 
  * !PanelRenderer now displays some common Exif tags.

= 1.0 (28 November 2009) =
  * Added the Gallery view mode. 
  * Modified the hit testing, scrolling and the custom renderers to work with the Gallery view mode.

= 0.18 (27 November 2009) =

  * Control border is now drawn by the framework.
  * Fixed a bug in layout manager where number of visible columns or rows could be zero when the control is sized too small.
  * Added the new overridable method, !OnLayout to the !ImageListViewRenderer. It can be used to modify the size of the item area by custom renderers.
  * Added the new !PanelRenderer. 
  * Fixed a bug in !TilesRenderer where the caption font was requested before being created. 
  * Fixed the !ImageListView.!HitTest method to work with the new !ImageListViewRenderer.!OnLayout method.

= 0.17 (26 November 2009) =

  * Maximum size of the thumbnail cache can now be (approximately) set by the user using the new !ImageListView.!CacheLimit property. 
  * Removing items now correctly removes associated thumbnails from the cache. To decrease the number of locks, removed item thumbnails are purged from the cache in batches of 25% of !ImageListView.!CacheLimit.

= 0.16 (24 November 2009) =

  * Caption font of !TilesRenderer is now disposed properly. 
  * Removed the !CacheSize property from !ImageListView and !ImageListViewCacheManager. It wasn't properly implemented and resulted in deadlocks. 
  * Added a check to !ImageListViewRenderer.Render() to return immediately if the renderer is disposed.

= 0.15 (24 November 2009) =

  * Zoom percentage can now be specified in the constructor of !ZoomingRenderer.

= 0.14 (23 November 2009) =

  * !ZoomingRenderer is now threaded. 
  * Organized custom renderers in a static !ImageListViewRenderers class.

= 0.13 (23 November 2009) =

  * Fixed a bug in rendering draw order. 
  * Added the !GetImage() method to !ImageListViewItem. 
  * Added !ItemAreaBounds and !ColumnHeaderBounds properties to !ImageListViewRenderer.
  * Added new custom renderers.

= 0.12 (22 November 2009) =

  * Renderers can now draw items in a specific order using the new !ImageListViewRenderer.!ItemDrawOrder property. A finer control is also possible using the new !ImageListViewItem.ZOrder property.
  * The previous renderer is now properly disposed when !ImageListView.!SetRenderer is called.

= 0.11 (21 November 2009) =

  * Added the Clip property and the !InitializeGraphics virtual function to !ImageListViewRenderer.

= 0.10 (19 November 2009) =

  * Fixed an issue where the item border was not drawn if the item had the focus.

= 0.9 (18 November 2009) =

  * Fixed a curious bug in the layout code. It appears that Control.Visible returns not what you set in code, but whether the control is actually visible (the control and its parent are visible) This resulted in a stack overflow if the layout code was called before !ImageListView became visible. Visible property of child scrollbars always returned false because their parent was not visible. It was quite hard to identify the issue, although the fix was straightforward (keep separate variables for scrollbars visible properties).

= 0.8 (16 November 2009) =

  * Fixed a bug in the !OnDragDrop handler. The base class method was being called at the start of the function. It is now called at the end, after the drop operation is completed.

= 0.7 (14 November 2009) =

  * Reduced the number of locks in worker threads.
  * A list of visible items is being kept to speed up item lookups.

= 0.6 (12 November 2009) =

Project moved to Google Code.

== Previous Release Notes ==

  * The framework requirement is droppped down to .NET 2.0. This version is identical to previous 3.5 version both feature-wise and performance-wise.
  * Item properties are read by a background thread to speed up item addition.
  * Items can now be reordered by dragging them in the control.
  * Item details added for image dimensions and resolution.
  * Fixed a bug while iterating the selected item collection threw an exception.
  * Item file types are now cached. Adding items should be much faster.
  * Fixed a bug where right clicking on the control when the item collection is empty threw an exception.
  * Fixed a bug where removing items while iterating through the selected item collection threw an exception.
  * Fixed a visual glitch where removing all items from the control at once did not set the scroll coordinates to 0, 0.
  * Added drag&drop support. Image files recognized by the .NET framework (whatever Image.!FromStream accepts) can now be dragged on to the control. Also image thumbnails can now be dragged from the control as files. Drag&drop behavior can be customized using the !AllowDrag and !AllowDrop properties.
  * Added a new option for detecting duplicate filenames. When !AllowDuplicateFileNames property is set to false, the control will silently refuse to add an image file, if it already exists in the items collection. Comparison is made between filenames as case-insensitive ordinal string comparison.
  * Fixed a bug where right clicking on selected items cleared the selection.
  * Fixed a glitch where the control's text (hidden property) was serialized as null.
  * !ImageListView can now extract embedded EXIF thumbnails. A new property (!UseEmbeddedThumbnails) is added to customize this behavior.
  * A public Index property is added to the !ImageListViewItem class.
